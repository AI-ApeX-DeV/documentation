# TCET Open Source Documentation Team

One of the key visions of the TCET Open Source Organization is to provide users of our software and others willing to contribute with access to project documentation for all of our current projects. The organization recognizes the importance of clear and concise documentation when creating open-source software, to ensure it's development is rapid, continous & traceble.

The "Documentation Website" will not only have our project documentation, but also blogs. It will also act as our Organization's Website.

This is the source code of the Documentation Website.
