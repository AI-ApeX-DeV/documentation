# TCET Open Source Documentation Team

The primary goal of TCET Open Source is to provide other users with access to project documentation for all of their college projects. The organization recognizes the importance of clear and concise documentation when creating open-source software, and believes that Docusaurus is a valuable tool to achieve this goal.

The "Documentation Website" will not only have our project documentation, but also blogs. It will also act as our Organization's Website.

This is the source code of the Documentation Website.
