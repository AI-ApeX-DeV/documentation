The primary goal of **TCET Open Source** is to provide other users with access to project documentation for all of their college projects. The organization recognizes the importance of clear and  concise documentation when creating open-source software, and believes that Docusaurus is a valuable tool to achieve this goal.

Through the use of the website, visitors can access useful information about the `goals`, `methods`, and `benefits` of the projects, as well as technical details like `code snippets`, `images`, and `diagrams`. This documentation will help readers understand how the projects work and their potential applications. **TCET Open Source** is dedicated to keeping their documentation up-to-date to ensure that visitors have access to the latest information.

By utilizing Docusaurus, **TCET Open Source** will be able to develop a user-friendly documentation website that is visually appealing and easy to navigate. Overall, by providing project documentation, the organization hopes to contribute to the open-source community and promote knowledge-sharing and collaboration.
