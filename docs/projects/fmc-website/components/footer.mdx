The footer component is a section of a web page that is placed at the bottom and is separate from the main content area. It serves as a container for information that is relevant to the entire page.

## Footer

  **Here's the implemented code:** 

  <hr class="footer-line">
<div class="text-center">
    Designed & Developed by: Sagar Pathare (TCET 2015-2019)<br>
    Packaged and Maintained by: Gaurang Vishwakarma (TCET 2019-2023)<br>
    <img src="./assets/images/tos-logo.png" alt="TCET Open Source Logo">
</div> 

**Here's a breakdown explanation of the Footer component:**
- `<hr class="footer-line">`: This is an HTML `<hr>` (horizontal rule) element with the CSS class `footer-line`. It is used to create a horizontal line as a visual separator.
- `<div class="text-center">`: This is a `<div>` element with the CSS class `text-center`. The class applies a styling rule to center-align the content within the `<div>` horizontally.
- `<img src="./assets/images/tos-logo.png" alt="TCET Open Source Logo">`: This is an `<img>` (image) element that displays an image. The `src` attribute specifies the path to the image file, in this case, "./assets/images/tos-logo.png". The `alt` attribute provides alternative text that is displayed if the image cannot be loaded. In this case, the alternative text is "TCET Open Source Logo".  

- The purpose of this code is to create a footer section that includes a horizontal line, information about the website designer and developer, information about the website packager and maintainer, and an image representing the TCET Open Source logo.
