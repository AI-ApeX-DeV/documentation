description: Footer Component in Fill My Cycle Website 
sidebar_label: Footer
---
The footer component is a section of our web page that is placed at the bottom and is separate from the main content area. It serves as a container for information that is relevant to the entire page.

  **Here's How we implemented the code:-**

```html {2-5} showLineNumbers
<hr class="footer-line">
   <div class="text-center">
     Designed & Developed by: Sagar Pathare (TCET 2015-2019)<br>
       Packaged and Maintained by: Gaurang Vishwakarma (TCET 2019-2023)<br>
        <img src="./assets/images/tos-logo.png" alt="TCET Open Source Logo">
</div> 
```

**Here's a breakdown explanation of the Footer component:**
1. `<hr class="footer-line">`:- This is an HTML `<hr>` (horizontal rule) element with the CSS class `footer-line`. We used it to create a horizontal line as a visual separator.
2. `<div class="text-center">`:- This is a `<div>` element with the CSS class `text-center`. The class applies a styling rule to center-align the content within the `<div>` horizontally.
3. `<img src="./assets/images/tos-logo.png" alt="TCET Open Source Logo">`:- This is an `<img>` (image) element that displays our logo. The `src` attribute specifies the path of our logo file, in this case, "./assets/images/tos-logo.png". The `alt` attribute provides alternative text that is displayed if the image cannot be loaded. In this case, the alternative text is "TCET Open Source Logo".  


**The purpose of this code is to create a footer section in our website that includes a horizontal line, information about the website designer and developer, information about the website packager and maintainer, and an image representing Our website.**
